The `struct folio` is a key component data structure of the memory
management system of Linux and plays a crucial role in various aspects
of the kernel, including (but not limited to) virtual memory, page
cache, filesystems, file I/O, device drivers.

Formally speaking, the `struct folio` represents a physically, virtually,
and logically contiguous set of bytes. It is a power-of-two in size and
aligned to that same power-of-two. The size of a struct folio is at least
as large as the PAGE_SIZE, which is the system-defined page size.

In the context of the page cache subsystem, a struct folio maps page frames
that cache file data. If a `struct folio` is in the page cache, it is
located at a file offset that is a multiple of the power-of-two size of
itself. This alignment allows for efficient management and retrieval of
file data within the page cache.

Although a struct folio may be mapped into user-space at an address with an
arbitrary page offset, its kernel virtual address is aligned to its size.
This alignment ensures that the struct folio can be efficiently accessed
and manipulated by the kernel.

The `struct folio` carries information about a page frame, such as the
state, attributes, and usage. It is defined in the kernel header file
`include/linux/folio.h`.

Here's an overview of the important fields and functionalities provided
by the `struct folio`:

1. `page`: This field points to the underlying first `struct page`
associated with the folio. The `struct page` represents a physical page
frame in memory.

2. `flags`: The `flags` field holds various attributes and state
information about the folio. It includes flags such as whether the page
is locked, dirty, or writeback, among others.

3. `lru`: The `lru` field is used to maintain the folio in the page
cache's LRU (Least Recently Used) list. This helps the kernel manage page
eviction and replacement.

4. `mapping`: This field points to the address_space structure that the
page belongs to. It provides a link to the file or device associated with
the page, allowing efficient file I/O operations.

5. `index`: The `index` field specifies the offset within the file or
device where the first page is located. It is used for mapping logical
addresses to physical addresses during file I/O.

6. `private`: This field can be used by the filesystem or device driver to
store additional information specific to their needs. It provides a flexible
mechanism for extending the functionality of the `struct folio` for
different use cases.

7. `page_count`: The `page_count` field tracks the reference count of the
folio. It allows the kernel to determine when a page can be safely freed or
reused.

Understanding the key fields of the `struct folio` data structure is crucial
for developers working on file systems, storage drivers, or any other component
that deals with page caching and virtual memory.

By leveraging the `struct folio` and its associated functions and macros
defined in `include/linux/folio.h`, developers can efficiently manipulate and
manage page frames in the kernel, enabling optimized file I/O operations,
memory usage, and caching strategies.
