Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] highmem: Extend kmap_local_page() documentation

The Highmem's interface is evolving and the current documentation does not
reflect the intended uses of each of the calls. Furthermore, after a
recent series of reworks, the differences of the calls can still be
confusing and may lead to the expanded use of calls which are deprecated.

This series is the second round of changes towards an enhanced
documentation of the Highmem's interface; at this stage the patches are
only focused to kmap_local_page().

In addition it also contains some minor clean ups.
