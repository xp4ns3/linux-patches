Subject: [PATCH] nfs: Replace kmap() with kmap_local_page()

The use of kmap() is being deprecated in favor of kmap_local_page().

With kmap_local_page(), the mapping is per thread, CPU local and not
globally visible. Furthermore, the mapping can be acquired from any context
(including interrupts).

Therefore, use kmap_local_page() in nfs_do_filldir() because this mapping
is per thread, CPU local, and not globally visible.

I cannot test this patch for several reasons. While these changes seem safe
and trivial, I would feel better if people familiar with NFS could take the
time to properly test this patch. Thank you.
