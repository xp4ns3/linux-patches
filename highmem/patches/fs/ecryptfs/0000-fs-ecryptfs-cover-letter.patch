Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] fs/ecryptfs: Replace kmap{,_atomic}() with kmap_local_page()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

kmap() and kmap_atomic() have been deprecated in favor of
kmap_local_page().

Therefore, replace kmap() and kmap_atomic() with kmap_local_page().

Tested in a QEMU/KVM x86_32 VM, 6GB RAM, booting a kernel with
HIGHMEM64GB enabled.

v1->v2: Patches 1/3 and 2/3 were not grouped in a series. Patch 3/3 is
new. Therefore, currently one series groups all conversions needed if
fs/ecryptfs. The subject of 2/3 changed to differentiate between it and
3/3. Furthermore, the commit messages of 1/3 and 2/3 have been largely
reworked.

Fabio M. De Francesco (3):
  fs/ecryptfs: Replace kmap() with kmap_local_page()
  fs/ecryptfs: Use kmap_local_page() in ecryptfs_write()
  fs/ecryptfs: Use kmap_local_page() in copy_up_encrypted_with_header()
