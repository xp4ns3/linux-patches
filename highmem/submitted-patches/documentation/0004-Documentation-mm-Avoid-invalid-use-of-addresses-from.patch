Subject: [PATCH 4/7] Documentation/mm: Avoid invalid use of addresses from kmap_local_page()

Users of kmap_local_page() must be absolutely sure to not hand kernel
virtual address obtained calling kmap_local_page() on highmem pages to
other contexts because those pointers are thread local, therefore, they
are no longer valid across different contexts.

Extend the documentation of kmap_local_page() to warn users about the
above-mentioned potential invalid use of pointers returned by
kmap_local_page().

   Nesting kmap_local_page() and kmap_atomic() mappings is allowed to a certain
   extent (up to KMAP_TYPE_NR) but their invocations have to be strictly ordered
   because the map implementation is stack based. See kmap_local_page() kdocs
