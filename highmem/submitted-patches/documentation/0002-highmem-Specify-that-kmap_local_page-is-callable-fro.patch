Subject: [PATCH 2/7] highmem: Specify that kmap_local_page() is callable from interrupts

In a recent thread about converting kmap() to kmap_local_page(), the
safety of calling kmap_local_page() was questioned.[1]

"any context" should probably be enough detail for users who want to
know whether or not kmap_local_page() can be called from interrupts.
However, Linux still has kmap_atomic() which might make users think they
must use the latter in interrupts.

Add "including interrupts" for better clarity.
