Subject: [PATCH 0/3] drm/i915: Replace kmap() with kmap_local_page()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

kmap() is being deprecated in favor of kmap_local_page().

There are two main problems with kmap(): (1) It comes with an overhead as
mapping space is restricted and protected by a global lock for
synchronization and (2) it also requires global TLB invalidation when the
kmapâ€™s pool wraps and it might block when the mapping space is fully
utilized until a slot becomes available.

With kmap_local_page() the mappings are per thread, CPU local, can take
page faults, and can be called from any context (including interrupts).
It is faster than kmap() in kernels with HIGHMEM enabled. Furthermore,
the tasks can be preempted and, when they are scheduled to run again, the
kernel virtual addresses are restored and still valid.

Since its use in drm/i915 is safe everywhere, it should be preferred.

Therefore, replace kmap() with kmap_local_page() in drm/i915.

These changes should be tested in an 32 bits system, booting a kernel
with HIGHMEM enabled. Unfortunately I have no i915 based hardware,
therefore any help with testing would be greatly appreciated.
