Subject: [PATCH 6/6] highmem: Delete a sentence from kmap_local_page() kdocs

kmap_local_page() should always be preferred in place of kmap() and
kmap_atomic(). "Only use when really necessary." is not consistent with
the Documentation/mm/highmem.rst and these kdocs it embeds.

Therefore, delete the above-mentioned sentence from kdocs.
