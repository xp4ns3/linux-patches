Subject: [PATCH 0/6] highmem: Extend kmap_local_page() documentation

This series of patches rework and extends the documentation of
kmap_local_page(). Parts of this task are carried out in the kdocs of
highmem.h, while other parts are changed in highmem.rst. Please note
that highmem.rst embeds kdocs included from highmem.h and
highmem-internal.h.

<ira>
This says what the series is doing and how but not really why.

Cover letters and commit messages should focus on the why.

I would say:

The highmem interface is evolving and the current documentation does not
reflect the intended uses of each of the calls.

Furthermore, the differences of the calls can be confusing and may lead to
the expanded use of calls which are deprecated.

In addition make minor clean ups.
