Subject: [PATCH 0/3] staging: r8188eu: Shorten and simplify calls chain 

io_ops abstraction is useless in this driver, since there is only one ops
registration. Without io_ops we can get rid of indirect calls mess and
shorten the calls chain.

Shorten the calls chain of rtw_read8/16/32() down to the actual reads.
For this purpose unify the three usb_read8/16/32 into the new
usb_read(); make the latter parameterizable with 'size'; embed most of
the code of usbctrl_vendorreq() into usb_read() and use in it the new
usb_control_msg_recv() API of USB Core.

Shorten the calls chain of rtw_write8/16/32() down to the actual writes.
For this purpose unify the four usb_write8/16/32/N() into the new
usb_write(); make the latter parameterizable with 'size'; embed most of
the code of usbctrl_vendorreq() into usb_write() and use in it the new
usb_control_msg_send() API of USB Core.

The code with the modifications was thoroughly tested by Pavel Skripkin 
using a TP-Link TL-WN722N v2 / v3 [Realtek RTL8188EUS]
